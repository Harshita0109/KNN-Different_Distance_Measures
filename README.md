# KNN-Different_Distance_Measures
**Implement KNN classier and experiment with the following concepts:**
1. Check the performance of KNN with different distance measures
2. Check the performance of KNN with binary, categorical & numerical data

**Numerical**
1. Euclidean Distance represents the shortest distance between two points. It is used to calculate the distance between two rows of data that have numerical values, such a floating point or integer values.
2. Manhattan Distance is the sum of absolute differences between points across all the dimensions. It is a good measure to use if the input variables are not similar in type such as age, height, etc.

**Binary**
1. Euclidean Distance represents the shortest distance between two points. It is used to calculate the distance between two rows of data that have numerical values, such a floating point or integer values.
2. Jaccard distance can be used to measure when categorical variables are present in the data.

**Categorical**
1. Hamming Distance measures the similarity between two strings of the same length. The Hamming Distance between two strings of the same length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different. It take all the categorical attributes and for each, count one if the value is not the same between two points. The Hamming distance is then the number of attributes for which the value was different.
2. Jaccard distance can be used to measure when categorical variables are present in the data.
